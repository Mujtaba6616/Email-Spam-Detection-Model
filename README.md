| **F1-Score** | 95.2% |

## üñ•Ô∏è Interactive Interface

The project includes a **modern web-based interface** featuring:

* **Real-time Analysis:** Instant spam/ham classification
* **Confidence Scoring:** Probability percentages for predictions
* **Responsive Design:** Clean, professional UI with dark theme
* **Easy to Use:** Simple text input with one-click analysis

### Usage Example:

```python
# Load the trained model
import joblib
detector = joblib.load('email_spam_detector.pkl')

# Analyze an email
sample_email = "Congratulations! You've won $1000000! Click here now!"
prediction = detector.predict([sample_email])
confidence = detector.predict_proba([sample_email])

print(f"Prediction: {'SPAM' if prediction[0] == 1 else 'HAM'}")
print(f"Confidence: {max(confidence[0]) * 100:.1f}%")
```
